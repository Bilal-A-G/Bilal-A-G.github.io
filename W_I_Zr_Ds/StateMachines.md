# State Machines

## Description

The state machine system in W_I_Zr_Ds provides you a new way to do control flow/conditionals.

Traditionally, all conditionals are done via booleans and if statements. However, this method breaks down quickly with lots of state to manage, and it's not easily changable. However, with the W_I_Zr_Ds state machine system, all complex conditionals can be handled easily without any booleans, and modified from the inspector.
